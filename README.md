Hello Dear,

We would like to bring to your attention the following challenges we have encountered:
1) Issue in Data Migration: We faced difficulties with the Data Migration process, which led us to include all entities in the shared project to address the issue.
2) Challenges in Generating the Appropriate Structure: We experienced some difficulties in designing the appropriate structure. This was partly due to the lack of clarity in the lectures, which made it challenging to incorporate them into the same solution effectively.

Your guidance or any recommendations on how to address these issues would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your understanding and support.
